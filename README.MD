# Python OOP and Basic Programming Practice

This repository is a comprehensive collection of Python programs designed to demonstrate fundamental programming concepts alongside core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Encapsulation. Additionally, it covers essential Python basics including variables, operators, input/output handling, and conditional logic.

## Concepts Covered

### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Overview

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm centered around organizing code into objects and classes that represent real-world entities. This approach enhances modularity, promotes code reuse, and simplifies complex software design. 

The four foundational pillars of OOP featured in this repository are:

- *Abstraction:* Abstraction involves hiding the complex internal workings of a class and exposing only what is necessary to the user. This reduces complexity and allows users to interact with objects through a simplified interface without needing to understand implementation details. For example, starting a car is reduced to a simple action from the perspective of the user, while the intricate mechanisms involved remain hidden.

- *Encapsulation:* This ensures that an object's data (its attributes) and behavior (its methods) are bundled together, restricting direct access to some of the object's components and thereby protecting its state.

- *Inheritance:* Inheritance allows classes to inherit properties and behaviors from other classes, facilitating code reuse and establishing a natural hierarchy among classes.

- *Polymorphism:* Polymorphism enables entities such as functions or operators to handle different data types or classes seamlessly, providing flexibility in code execution.

### Basic Python Programming

This collection also covers various essential Python programming constructs:

- Output and printing techniques.
- Variables and their data types.
- Arithmetic, relational, assignment, and logical operators.
- Conversion and casting between data types.
- Accepting user input and formatting output.
- Control flow with conditionals.
- Simple practical algorithms such as calculating areas, averages, sums, and evaluating logical conditions like even/odd, multiples, and comparisons.
